## Impute z-statistics for missing variants using observed z-statistics and LD matrix

<div style="text-align: justify">
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performs tests of association across millions of genetic variants.  The `imputez` package provides a series of statistical methods to impute the z-statistic for missing genetic variants by using LD information from a reference panel.  The package achieves high accuracy by regularizing the LD matrix and uses a probabilistic whitening transformation with implicit covariance to scale to high-dimensional datasets.  While standard analysis is cubic in the number of features, $p$, the package implements an algorithm that is the minimum of $\mathcal{O}(n p^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2 p)$.  For large number of features, this is can be a dramatic speedup.


### Methods 
- `imputezDecorr()`: scalable imputation using probabilistic whitening transformation with implicit covariance as implemented in the `decorrelation` package.
- `imputez()`: standard method for comparison that is cubic time in $p$

### Installation
```r
devtools::install_github("GabrielHoffman/imputez")
```

#### Example code
```r
library(imputez)
library(GenomicDataStream)
library(mvtnorm)
library(dplyr)

# VCF file for reference
file <- system.file("extdata", "test.vcf.gz", package = "GenomicDataStream")

# initialize data stream
gds = GenomicDataStream(file, "DS", initialize=TRUE)

# read genotype data from reference
dat = getNextChunk(gds)

# simulate z-statistics with correlation structure
# from the LD of the reference panel
z = c(rmvnorm(1, rep(0, 10), cor(dat$X)))

# Combine z-statistics with variant ID, position, etc
df = dat$info %>%
    mutate(z = z, GWAS_A1 = A1, GWAS_A2 = A2) %>%
    rename(REF_A1 = A1, REF_A2 = A2)

# Given observed z-statistics and 
# GenomicDataStream of reference panel,
# Impute z-statistics from variants missing z-statistics.
# Here drop variant 2, and then impute its z-statistic
# Defaults to run imputezDecorr / decorrelate in the backend
res = run_imputez(df[-2,], gds, 10000, 1000)

# Results of imputed z-statistics
res
#> # A tibble: 1 Ã— 9
